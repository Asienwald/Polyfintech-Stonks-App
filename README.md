## The Problem
More and more youths are entering the workforce without knowing how to manage their finances properly due to lack of financial literacy and not having good financial hygiene.

Together with the growing prominence of cryptocurrency in today's economy, it is essential for youths to know how to leverage on it in order to address their financial needs through informed investing.

However, there isn't a student-focused decentralised app available at the moment to allow students to explore this area.

## The Solution
Kar is a decentralied application aimed at educating and empowering youths on financial literacy and the benefits cryptocurrencies can bring.

Kar is powered by Stonks, our very own ERC-20 token/Stablecoin made for and by students.

Kar aims to address 5 main needs of students, aside from their financial needs:
- Lack of experience
- Lack of financial literacy
- Lack of cryptocurrency knowledge
- Lack of friends

## Features
STNKs is inter-exchangeable with DAI, hence making 1 STNK = 1 DAI = 1USD.

Our app also attracts users through our very own marketplace where students will be able to exchange DAI with popular goods and services (among students) based on their learning milestones.

Our very own mascot Jess will also be our virtual guide in order to ensure students are educated on good financial hygiene practices and the workings of cryptocurrency in today's economy
